## PROJECTS
1. **Problem Solving with Excel Spreadsheets** : This file contains all the issues that need to be resolved using the Microsoft Excel tool. [Go to PDF File](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20using%20Microsoft%20Excel/Problem%20Solving%20with%20Excel%20Spreadsheets%20Part.pdf)
  - **Car Inventory** : The task involves identifying the top drivers by miles within a car inventory dataset and creating a scatter chart to visualize the relationship between car inventory and miles driven. This requires analyzing the dataset to determine which drivers have accumulated the highest mileage and then plotting a scatter chart to display the distribution of miles driven across different vehicles in the inventory.--> [Go to Project..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20using%20Microsoft%20Excel/Car%20Inventory/README.md)
  - **Career Decisions** : The task involves creating a decision matrix to aid in career decisions. This matrix will include various factors such as pay, job market demand, personal enjoyment, talent fit, required schooling, and potentially other relevant criteria for each job option. Each job will be evaluated based on these factors, and a total score will be calculated to determine the most suitable job option. The total score will be derived from weighting and summing the individual scores for each criterion, providing a quantitative basis for decision-making.--> [Go to Project..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20using%20Microsoft%20Excel/Career%20Decisions)
