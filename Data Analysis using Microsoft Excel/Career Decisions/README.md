# Career Decisions Decision Matrix

## Overview
This repository contains a decision matrix designed to assist in making career decisions. The decision matrix evaluates multiple job options based on various criteria such as pay, job market demand, personal enjoyment, talent fit, required schooling, and other relevant factors. Each job option is assessed using these criteria, and a total score is calculated to determine the most suitable career option.

## Decision Matrix Criteria
- **Pay**: The salary or compensation offered by each job option.
- **Job Market Demand**: The demand for professionals in the respective job field.
- **Personal Enjoyment**: The level of personal satisfaction or enjoyment expected from each job.
- **Talent Fit**: The alignment between the individual's skills and talents and the requirements of the job.
- **Required Schooling**: The level of education or training required for each job option.
- **Other Relevant Factors**: Any additional criteria deemed relevant to the career decision-making process.

## Total Score Calculation
The total score for each job option is derived from weighting and summing the individual scores assigned to each criterion. The weighting reflects the relative importance of each criterion in the decision-making process.
