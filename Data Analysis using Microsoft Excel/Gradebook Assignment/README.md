# Gradebook Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a gradebook assignment, which involves utilizing conditional formatting to visually represent different criteria within a dataset. The assignment includes highlighting cells based on specific conditions or ranges of values. Additionally, bar charts are created to display the data, enabling a visual comparison of the different criteria.

## Tasks
- **Conditional Formatting**: Implement conditional formatting to visually represent different criteria within the dataset. This may include highlighting cells based on specific conditions such as grade ranges, attendance records, or performance indicators.
- **Bar Charts**: Create bar charts to display the data from the gradebook assignment. The bar charts will allow for a visual comparison of the different criteria, providing insights into student performance, attendance trends, or other relevant metrics.

## Implementation
- **Conditional Formatting**: Utilize Excel or Google Sheets to apply conditional formatting rules to the gradebook dataset. Customize the rules to highlight cells based on the specified criteria.
- **Bar Charts**: Use Excel, Google Sheets, or any other appropriate tool to create bar charts representing the data from the gradebook assignment. Customize the charts to display the relevant criteria and facilitate visual comparison.
